# Supervised-Learning-Project-on-Python-SVC-KNN-Logistic-

This project was made on Python using the Jupyter Notebook. 
The dataset is downloaded from the URL: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data

3 Supervised Learning models are implemented on this dataset:

1. Logistic Regression , 2. K-nearest-neighbors, 3. Support Vector Classification (SVC)

The models are evaluated using the accuracy metric. K-Fold Cross validation is applied with 10 folds and the validation ratio is kept at 0.3
